#Tea Time
A theme for WordPress made by [HerrHerrmann](http://herrherrmann.net).

I'm using WordPress features that require at least WordPress 4.0 (for now).

#Next Steps
- [ ] mobile menu
- [ ] post thumbnails
- [ ] different post formats (standard, picture, ...?)
- [ ] password protection of posts/pages
- [ ] i18n / pot file
- [ ] sidebar(s) / widget areas
- [ ] divide into public/private branches (because not everyone needs my software custom post type)
- [x] style for sticky posts
- [x] ['read more' feature](http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More)

#Contributing
Always looking forward to nice people improving this theme with fixes or translations!
